# DT4X-on-TwoTank-System

This repository goes along with the article Tree based Diagnosis Enhanced with Meta Knowledge Applied to Dynamic Systems written by Louis Goupil, Louise Travé-Massuyès, Elodie Chanthery, Thibault Kohler and Sébastien Delautier.
It is used to store the dataset used as input to DT4X in order to build the explainable diagnosis tree.

The folder Tree Evolution contains images of the tree at different steps of the training and the final form of the tree.
